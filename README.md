# Self-Refine ICL: Iterative Self-Refinement in Transformer In-Context Learning

This repository contains the code for experiments on iterative self-refinement in transformers trained for in-context learning (ICL) on linear systems.

## Problem Setting

We study whether transformers trained for ICL on linear systems can iteratively refine predictions at inference time. Given a symmetric positive-definite matrix A and K context examples {(b_i, x_i*)} where x_i* = A^{-1}b_i, the model predicts x* for a query b_query.

## Key Finding

**Baseline Failure**: Naively feeding predictions back as additional context causes catastrophic degradation (~1600x MSE increase).

**Solution - Residual Prediction**: Training with a dual objective enables iterative refinement:
- Direct prediction loss: L_direct = ||f(C, b_query) - x*||^2
- Residual prediction loss: L_residual = ||f(C, b_query, x_tilde) - (x* - x_tilde)||^2

Where x_tilde is a noisy estimate and the model learns to predict corrections.

## Results

| Condition Number | Samples Improved | Avg Improvement |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| kappa in [1, 10]     | 86%              | 1.35x           |
| kappa in [10, 50]    | 68%              | 1.10x           |
| kappa in [50, 100]   | 82%              | 1.17x           |
| kappa in [100, 200]  | 64%              | 1.07x           |
| **Overall**      | **75%**          | **1.17x**       |

## Method Details

### Architecture Modification
The current estimate x_tilde is encoded with a distinct role embedding (VEC_SECONDARY) separate from ground-truth solutions (OUTPUT). The query sequence becomes:

```
[SEP, A, SEP, b_1, x_1*, ..., SEP, b_query, x_tilde, MASK]
```

The model outputs the residual at MASK position. Inference proceeds as:
```
x_0 = f(C, b_query)              # Initial prediction
x_{k+1} = x_k + f(C, b_query, x_k)  # Refinement iterations
```

### Key Insights
1. **Explicit residual prediction** rather than direct solution prediction
2. **Role-based disambiguation** of estimates from ground truth
3. **Fixed context structure** across iterations
